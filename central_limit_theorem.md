## Central limit theorem

*	With sample size n>=30, regardless the distribution of the population, all sample mean will follow a normal distribution, with variance being equal to the variance of the population divided by sample size.

*	The central limit theorem (CLT) is a statistical theory that states that given a sufficiently large sample size from a population with a finite level of variance, the mean of all samples from the same population will be approximately equal to the mean of the population. Furthermore, all of the samples will follow an approximate normal distribution pattern, with all variances being approximately equal to the variance of the population divided by each sample's size.
