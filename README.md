Covering the major kinds of distributions

1. Normal distribution

A **discrete** probability distribution that expresses the probability of a given number of **discrete** events (e.g., number of visitors on an Amazon website) occurring in a fixed interval of time (e.g., between 10:00-10:30pm on a Tuesday night) or space if these events occur with a known constant rate (e.g., on average, there are 1000 visitors between 10-10:30pm on a Tuesday night) and independently of the time since the last event.

Example: the probability of n visitiors between 10-10:30am on a Tuesday night:<br>

3. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution">Binomial distribution</a>

A **discrete** probability distribution of the number of successes in a sequence of n independent experiments (e.g., n=10 coins tossed), each asking a yesâ€“no question (e.g., coin toss being a head or tail).

Example: the probability of heads over 10 coin tosses:<br>
