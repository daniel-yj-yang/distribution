Covering the major kinds of distributions

1. Normal distribution



2. Poisson distribution

The probability of a given number of **discrete** events (e.g., number of visitors on an Amazon website) occurring in a fixed interval of time (e.g., between 10:00-10:30pm on a Tuesday night) or space if these events occur with a known constant rate (e.g., on average, there are 1000 visitors between 10-10:30pm on a Tuesday night) and independently of the time since the last event.
